# PianoChordProgression
A piano chord progression app that I have built for one of my friends, the owner of Taylor Academy of Music, to use as a tool for teaching his music students. When we have updated the app for different categories and better use for music theory students we will have make it public on platforms Android, Apple, Mac OS X, and Windows

Unfortunately, I will not be able to add the directories and files that the app uses for its functionality as those are property of Taylor Academy of Music. Once the app is ready for us to put public in stores the music and photo files will be added. 

Until then we will be releasing the code for anybody wanting to see the progress and work ZichKoding has for our clients and customers.
