# PianoChordProgression v1.0
A piano chord progression app that I have built for one of my friends, the owner of Taylor Academy of Music, to use as a tool for teaching his music students. When we have updated the app for different categories and better use for music theory students, we will have make it public on platforms Android, Apple, Mac OS X, and Windows. Until then we will be releasing the code for anybody wanting to see the progress and work ZichKoding has for our clients and customers. 

## Version 1.0
__This app has only been ran and tested on Windows. If any bugs or issues arise please let me know!__
