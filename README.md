# PianoChordProgression
A piano chord progression app that I have built for one of my friends to use a tool for teaching his music students. When we have updated the app for different categories and better use for music theory students we will have make it public on platforms: Android, Apple, Mac OS X, and Windows

Until then we will be releasing the code for anybody wanting to see the progress and work ZichKoding has for our clients and customers.
